	<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

	<p>
		<span style="font-size: 16px">SlidePIN</span> is a PIN entry mechanism
		based on slide input method combined with a random numeric keypad. As
		slide input method ensures higher usability and security, random
		numeric keypad introduced, at a slight cost of usability,
		conspicuously enhances the security of SlidePIN. As an indirect entry
		mechanism, SlidePIN keeps users away from additional computation or
		memory burden. SlidePIN performs effectively against one-time shoulder
		surfing attack and better than 4-digit PIN mechanism against
		multi-time shoulder surfing attack.
	</p>
	<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
	<p>The 4-digit PIN (Personal Identification Numbers) mechanism that
		is used most widely asks users to input the PIN directly, which makes
		it vulnerable to shoulder surfing attacks. With better resistance
		against shoulder surfing attacks, invisible entry mechanism and
		indirect entry mechanism are proposed and developed. However, these
		mechanisms need either additional hardware or extra computation to
		ensure security and usability. The Word-Gesture Keyboard concept was
		proposed by Montgomery in 1982 and inspired by this concept, we
		propose SlidePIN as an indirect entry mechanism with a random numeric
		keypad and slide input method.</p>
	<h2>CONCEPT</h2>
	Design:
	<table>
		<tr>
			<td>
				<ol>
					<li>Slide input is faster. It has been shown that click input
						is an operation with more complexity than slide input, which
						suggests that slide input will help improve input efficiency.</li>
					<li>Slide input is more secure. As for slide input, a user
						tends to wittingly or unwittingly slide to other non-PIN numbers,
						making the userâ€™s PIN concealed in a slide sequence with more
						digits. This makes SlidePIN more secure than traditional click
						input method against shoulder surfing attacks.</li>
					<li>Input with a random numeric keypad is more secure. With a
						random numeric keypad introduced, randomness helps SlidePIN
						perform better against replay attacks.</li>
				</ol>

		</tr>
	</table>
	Implementation:
	<ol>
		<li>Setup Phase: Like 4-digit PIN, the user chooses 4 ordered
			digit numbers as the master secret between him/her and the
			smartphone, usually referred to a PIN.</li>
		<li>Unlocking Phase: Instead of directly input, the user touches
			and slides over a keypad passing all digits of PIN in order. As
			figure shows, the keypad is a random numeric keypad. In addition, the
			sliding process should start from '*' and end up with '#'. If slide
			sequence contains the PIN as its subsequence, the authentication will
			be passed. For instance, '1245' as a user's PIN, the user needs to
			slide over a trace starting from '*' and ending with '#' and
			subsequence '1245' has to be contained in exact order on the numeric
			keypad. As figure shows, '*381629458#' is one of the valid sliding
			traces which can unlock the phone.</li>
	</ol>

	<h2>EXPERIMENTS</h2>
	<p>To evaluate the usability and security of SlidePIN, we recruited
		in total 20 students as volunteers to conducted relevant experiments.
		Based on data obtained from these experiments, we analyzed the
		reasonable range of slide sequence, orientation time, unlock time,
		error rate and the capability of SlidePIN against multi-time shoulder
		surfing attacks.</p>
